# OSIAM - Open Source Identity and Access Management

OSIAM is a secure identity management solution providing REST based services for
authentication and authorization. We achieve this by implementing two important
open standards:

* [OAuth 2.0](http://oauth.net/2/)
* [SCIM v2](http://www.simplecloud.info/) (still in draft phase)

OSIAM is published under the MIT licence, giving you the greatest freedom possible to
utilize OSIAM in you project or product.
